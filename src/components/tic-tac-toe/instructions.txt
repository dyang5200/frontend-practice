Make a Tic-Tac-Toe Board.

Requirements:
- Players can take turns to place an X or an O on the board.
- A player wins if three of their marks are in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
- Display the current game status at the top: whose turn it is, winner (if any), or draw.
- Add a reset button to allow the game to be restarted at any time.

"Player X wins!"
"Player O wins!"
"Draw"
"Player X's turn"
"Player O's turn"
